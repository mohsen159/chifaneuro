the error handling use a form and imag in it for user feedback no you are using echo first too do 
every js func the are res of page will be add at the end of each file 
the ui should be dependent re use Please if possible 
the submit sould be a ajax request the response will add data use the form pattern to change stuff 



about the data used in the prosses 

when a product is showen you could use the name + dosage to make it more readble to the user 
the id of the products list is used in the predction algorithm beacuse after serten amount of time the product will be used in the prosses 
of bying again using the idea can make it more readble used to form this informarion again 

no logic for this 
we do more calculation in the frontend beacuse the server have alot of request  
think about the detalid information and leazy method fetching when shoing data to the user like when the modifaie button 
click to make changes or to see more info
